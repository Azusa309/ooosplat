OOOSplat is a local desktop application that turns an ordinary orbit video or image sequence into a 3D Gaussian Splatting project in one workflow. Choose source media, a project directory, and a quality preset, and OOOSplat automatically handles image preparation, camera reconstruction, training, PLY publishing, preview, adjustment, and export.

Windows and the Apple Silicon macOS Alpha provide FFmpeg, FFprobe, COLMAP, and Brush with the application. Linux support remains limited to an Ubuntu 24.04 LTS x86_64 Alpha. Every generation stage runs on the user's own CPU and GPU; input media, project data, models, and logs do not need to be uploaded to a cloud reconstruction or training service. The React interface calls the local Rust backend directly. Normal generation and preview do not require a separate HTTP server.

See the [OOOSplat Roadmap](ROADMAP_EN.md) for planned work.

> 0.6.0 adds multi-task management, transparent-media support, landscape video and offline HTML exports, plus upgrades to COLMAP, Auto Optimize, and training monitoring.

## Why OOOSplat

- **One-click Gaussian generation**: Select an input video or image-sequence folder, project directory, and quality preset. OOOSplat then runs image preparation, COLMAP camera reconstruction, Brush training, and `final.ply` publishing without manual engine setup or command-line orchestration.
- **Cross-platform compatibility**: Supports Windows, macOS, and Linux, bringing local Gaussian Splat generation to all three major desktop platforms. See the compatibility section below for specific OS and processor requirements.
- **Security and privacy protection**: Source media, extracted frames, camera reconstruction data, Gaussian models, and logs stay in the user-selected local project directory by default. The core generation workflow runs on the user's machine, so original videos, images, and models do not need to be uploaded to third-party reconstruction or training platforms. This reduces exposure risks during network transfer, cloud retention, and unauthorized access.
- **Fully local compute**: Reconstruction and training run on the user's own machine without remote compute services. COLMAP automatically uses a compatible local NVIDIA GPU when available and falls back to CPU otherwise, keeping both processing and data under the user's control.

## Key Features

- **One-click generation**: Create a Gaussian Splat from MP4/MOV video or a JPG, JPEG, and PNG image folder. OOOSplat handles image preparation, camera reconstruction, training, and PLY publishing.
- **Three quality presets**: Fast, Balanced, and Detailed are available. Auto Optimize selects suitable extraction, resolution, and training settings for the source and available VRAM.
- **Transparent media**: Transparent MOV and PNG files retain their original color and Alpha while OOOSplat creates the black-and-white masks required by COLMAP.
- **Multi-task workspace**: Group tasks into New Tasks, Completed, and Unfinished. Keep multiple drafts, reorder them, and automatically run the next task. Only one generation task runs at a time; tasks can be cancelled or resumed.
- **Reshoots**: Create a task from a completed project, reuse its camera and reconstruction for new media, then retrain from all registered images. The derived project does not overwrite the original.
- **Preview and editing**: Prefer WebGPU with a WebGL2 fallback. Use model translation axes and rotation rings, crop tools, point deletion, selection inversion, undo, and redo.
- **Multiple export formats**: Export portrait or landscape MP4, standalone offline HTML, and original or edited PLY files.
- **Local processing**: COLMAP reconstruction and Brush training run on the user's computer, using GPU acceleration when available.
- **Cross-platform and bilingual**: Supports Windows, Apple Silicon macOS, and Ubuntu, with Simplified Chinese and English interfaces.

### Gaussian Editing Shortcuts

- In Rectangle Select, drag with the left mouse button to replace the selection, use `Shift + drag` to add, and `Ctrl + drag` to remove. Use the middle mouse button to orbit, the right mouse button to pan, and the wheel to zoom.
- Yellow highlights show the temporary selection. Press `Delete` or `Backspace` to remove selected Gaussians non-destructively, or `Esc` to clear the temporary selection.
- In rectangle, sphere, or box selection, choose Invert selection or press `Ctrl + I` (`⌘ + I` on macOS) to switch which points are selected or retained.
- Sphere and box selection enter an orthographic view automatically. Switch between side, front, and top views, then adjust the volume in the viewport or through numeric fields.
- Use “Scene gizmo” in the Transform panel to switch between Move and Rotate; click the selected button again to turn the gizmo off. Left-drag an axis or ring to edit the model; drag empty space to orbit the camera. Both rings and numeric rotation pivot around the model center. Releasing commits one edit; `Esc` cancels the current gizmo drag. The gizmo mode is saved locally.
- Use `Ctrl + Z` to undo and `Ctrl + Shift + Z` or `Ctrl + Y` to redo. Transform, crop, and deletion changes share one history; camera movement and temporary highlights are not recorded.

## Processing Pipeline

```text
Input video or image sequence
  │
  ├─ Video: inspect with FFprobe and extract at the preset target FPS and working resolution; emit RGBA frames and masks for transparent media
  ├─ Images: scan headers and naturally sort filenames, copy source media, prefer hard links for internal reuse, and create Alpha masks when needed
  ├─ COLMAP: auto-select CPU/CUDA for features; sequential matching for video with loop detection when Auto Optimize is on, exhaustive for images
  ├─ COLMAP: incremental reconstruction and registration validation; Auto Optimize can attempt bridge-frame recovery
  ├─ Brush: train Gaussian Splats with an available GPU backend; Detailed adapts its profile to VRAM
  └─ Validate the PLY and atomically publish final.ply
```

A normal generation task continues to Brush when COLMAP produces at least one registered image and valid 3D points. Registration below 80% produces a quality warning rather than stopping the task solely for low coverage. A reshoot also requires at least one newly added image to register.

Image-sequence preflight reads only JPG/PNG headers to check counts, dimensions, and Alpha channels, without decoding all pixels. An Alpha channel does not necessarily contain transparent pixels; generation checks actual transparency and enables masks only when needed. Projects still keep an independent source copy. Internal images use hard links when supported and fall back to copying, with progress and logs throughout import and preparation.

## System Requirements

- Windows 11, x64.
- WebView2 Runtime support.
- Video export requires WebCodecs AVC support in WebView2. Animation mode remains available when encoding is unavailable, and the UI reports why export is disabled.
- An available GPU graphics backend for Brush training; a discrete GPU is recommended.
- COLMAP CUDA acceleration requires an NVIDIA GPU, Windows driver 580.00 or newer, and Compute Capability 7.5 or higher. OOOSplat automatically uses CPU when these requirements are not met; no manual configuration is required.
- Enough disk space for source-media copies, input images, COLMAP data, Brush intermediate files, and the final PLY. Long videos, large image sequences, and higher quality presets can require substantial space.
- The installer uses a per-machine installation and may require administrator privileges.

The COLMAP build bundled on Windows supports both CPU and CUDA GPU execution. OOOSplat automatically selects the available backend before each task. Brush uses its own available graphics backend; its GPU detection and runtime are independent of COLMAP.

### macOS 15+ Alpha (Apple Silicon only)

> The current deliverable is an unsigned, unnotarized `.app`/`.dmg` Alpha for M1 or newer Apple Silicon Macs. Intel Macs and Universal Binaries are not supported.

- Bundles native arm64 FFmpeg 8.1.2, a real standalone FFprobe, COLMAP 4.2.1 Ceres CPU CLI-only, and OOOBrush ooo-v1.0.0 CLI.
- Users do not install Homebrew, and OOOSplat never falls back to a Homebrew or system `PATH` engine.
- COLMAP always uses CPU in this Alpha. Brush independently selects an available Metal graphics backend, and the UI explains this distinction.
- Gatekeeper may block the unsigned Alpha on first launch. After confirming the app's source and integrity, follow [Apple's opening instructions](https://support.apple.com/en-us/102445) to use Open Anyway under System Settings → Privacy & Security. [macOS 15 and later no longer support the Control-click override](https://developer.apple.com/news/?id=saqachfa).

### Ubuntu 24.04 Alpha (x86_64 only)

> This Alpha delivers an x86_64 `.deb` package built on Ubuntu 24.04. It does not claim support for Ubuntu 22.04, other Linux distributions, or production deployment.

- Ubuntu 24.04 LTS, x86_64.
- A graphics backend and driver supported by Brush. Brush officially supports AMD, Intel, and NVIDIA GPUs. Current end-to-end validation used NVIDIA; CPU-only software graphics backends remain unverified but are not artificially blocked by startup checks.
- Source builds require Node.js 22.12+, Rust stable, and Tauri 2's WebKitGTK development dependencies; `.deb` users do not need these development tools.
- Ubuntu system `ffmpeg`/`ffprobe`; self-built, hash-locked COLMAP 4.2.1 is bundled, never selected from apt or PATH.
- OOOBrush ooo-v1.0.0 Linux x86_64 CLI, installed and verified by `npm run setup:engines`.

Install Ubuntu dependencies with:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y \
  build-essential curl file ffmpeg \
  libwebkit2gtk-4.1-dev libxdo-dev libssl-dev \
  libayatana-appindicator3-dev librsvg2-dev libdbus-1-dev
```

Install a working Vulkan driver for the graphics adapter, such as the proprietary NVIDIA driver or Mesa for AMD/Intel. Bundled COLMAP uses CUDA/Caspar on compatible NVIDIA devices and CPU/Ceres otherwise; Brush selects its graphics backend independently. Fully CPU-only software Vulkan has not yet been validated end to end.

After downloading the `OOOSplat-0.6.0-x64-linux` Artifact from the main-branch GitHub Actions run, install it with:

```bash
sudo apt install ./OOOSplat-0.6.0-x64-linux.deb
```

The `.deb` installs only FFmpeg/FFprobe through Ubuntu's package manager; pinned COLMAP and Brush runtimes are included.

## Installation and Use

Sample media: [Download from Quark Drive](https://pan.quark.cn/s/1dde892a1324) to test or try the generation workflow.

1. On Windows, run `OOOSplat-0.6.0-x64-windows.exe`. On an Apple Silicon Mac, open `OOOSplat-0.6.0-arm64-macos.dmg` and drag OOOSplat into Applications. On Ubuntu 24.04, run `sudo apt install ./OOOSplat-0.6.0-x64-linux.deb`.
2. Start OOOSplat and confirm that the bundled engine status in the top bar is healthy. Use the `EN / 中文` action in the upper-right corner to switch the interface language instantly.
3. Select a draft under “Task List → New Tasks,” or choose Add. In the left “Create New Task” panel, choose Video or Images and select a video file or image-sequence folder.
4. Choose the projects root; OOOSplat remembers the last location.
5. Select the Fast, Balanced, or Detailed quality preset.
6. Review the automatically detected COLMAP acceleration status and its explanation, then select “Start Generation.”
7. Follow the selected task's stages, progress, and logs on the left. Click any task on the right to switch details. Generated projects appear under Completed or Unfinished; completed projects offer Preview.
8. Edit the model in “Preview → Adjust.” Transforms, crops, and deletions are saved automatically in the project; each project's view is stored locally on this device. “Save edits” confirms that the current edits and view have been saved. To create or update `edit.ply`, choose “Export → Export PLY.”
9. Switch to Animation, choose Portrait or Landscape, and use Export → Export video for a 30 FPS, 23-second MP4 at 1080×1920 or 1920×1080 respectively. Both Adjust and Animation can export offline HTML. Exports use the current edits, can be cancelled, and provide access to the output folder on completion.
10. To add detail, choose Reshoot on a completed project. A reshoot draft appears in New Tasks instead of a separate configuration dialog. Choose new media in the left panel and start generation after validation. Use the original device, lens, and camera settings, with plenty of overlap between new and existing views.

Usage notes:

- Drag the divider between the panels to resize them; double-click it to restore the default ratio.
- Use the percentage button in the lower-right corner to reduce, reset, or increase the interface scale.
- Drafts are saved locally and their media is rechecked after restart. Running-task parameters cannot be changed, but other drafts remain editable. A second task cannot run concurrently.
- Drag new tasks to reorder them. Auto-run next task is off by default. When enabled, a successfully generated draft starts the immediate next valid draft; failure, cancellation, or an unprepared draft stops the queue without skipping ahead.
- Reshoots inherit the source project's quality and Auto Optimize settings. Original media cannot be submitted again. Images must match the original camera dimensions; video can be reduced to those dimensions at the same aspect ratio, but cannot be enlarged or recropped. Projects with missing reconstruction data or incompatible older image caches must be regenerated first.
- Reshoots extract features only for new images and extend matching and reconstruction in copies of the original database and model. Brush retrains from all registered images. The derived project inherits the model transform, not deletion or crop edits.
- Task pages keep the latest 500 log entries; complete engine logs remain in the project's `logs/` directory. The training runtime monitor is hidden by default and can be enabled under Settings → Interface.
- Delete moves the complete project, including source copies and intermediate files, to the Recycle Bin. OOOSplat does not fall back to permanent deletion if that operation fails.

## Quality Presets

With Auto Optimize enabled, video sequential matching uses offline loop detection in all three quality presets. It reuses the bundled vocabulary tree to help connect revisited viewpoints without a download. Matching may take longer, and not every capture will contain a detectable loop. Auto Optimize off leaves loop detection disabled; image sequences, reshoots, and Bridge retain their existing matching strategies. See the [parameter configuration guide](docs/pipeline-optimization-config.en.md).

“Auto Optimize (Experimental)” is enabled by default. Video is scaled once during extraction to the selected working resolution while preserving aspect ratio and never upscaling lower-resolution media. Actual sampling never exceeds the source FPS or total frame count. Image sequences keep every valid image at its original input resolution, while COLMAP and Brush still apply the selected preset's processing limits.

| Preset | Initial / bridge-frame target | Video working long edge | COLMAP long edge / maximum features | Brush training |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | --- |
| Fast | 6 / 9 FPS | Up to 1,600 | 1,200 / 4,096 | 8,000 iterations, maximum resolution 1,600 |
| Balanced | 8 / 12 FPS | Up to 1,920 | 1,600 / 8,192 | 15,000 iterations, maximum resolution 1,920 |
| Detailed | 12 / 15 FPS | Up to 3,200, 3,840, or native resolution according to VRAM | 3,200 / 16,384 | 30,000 iterations, with maximum resolution and Splat limit selected from VRAM |

Short videos target a minimum of 30 selected frames when the source provides enough frames. Initial and candidate sampling rates can therefore exceed the table's targets, but never exceed the source FPS or frame count.

Detailed starts from one of three VRAM profiles. Below 8 GB, or when VRAM cannot be read, the video and Brush long edges are capped at 3,200. From 8 GB inclusive to below 12 GB, they are capped at 3,840. At 12 GB or more, video stays at its native long edge and Brush uses that native long edge. All three Detailed profiles cap the COLMAP image long edge at 3,200. Bridge-frame recovery is attempted only when the initial video reconstruction has insufficient coverage and unused candidate frames remain. A failed attempt safely returns to the initial reconstruction, and the mechanism does not apply to image sequences. Detailed performs at most one automatic retry with a lower training profile after an explicit out-of-memory failure.

With Auto Optimize disabled, Fast, Balanced, and Detailed return to the legacy 30%, 50%, and 100% source-frame retention strategy. Video uses the legacy maximum long edge of 1,920, Brush resolutions return to 1,200, 1,600, and 2,000, and no additional Splat-count limit is applied.

## Project and File Locations

Each generation creates a separate directory under the projects root:

```text
<projects-root>\<yyyyMMdd-HHmmss_source-name>\
  final.ply             Final Gaussian Splatting file
  project.json          Project metadata and result metrics
  edit.ply              Exported edits; safely replaced on later PLY exports (optional)
  preview.mp4           First optional animation-preview video export
  preview-2.mp4         Later video exports are automatically numbered
  preview-landscape.mp4 Landscape video (later exports are automatically numbered)
  preview.html          Offline viewer (later exports use preview-2.html, etc.)
  state.json            Pipeline state
  source\
    input.<ext>         Source-video copy (video projects)
    images\             Normalized source copies (image-sequence projects)
  work\
    frames\             Extracted or prepared input images
    colmap_frames\      Dedicated COLMAP images, byte-identical to prepared input
    masks\              COLMAP masks for transparent input (when needed)
    reshoot-masks\      COLMAP masks for reshoot input (when needed)
    colmap\             COLMAP database and sparse reconstruction
    brush\              Brush dataset and training intermediates
  logs\                 Complete FFmpeg, COLMAP, and Brush engine logs
```

Windows-invalid characters are removed from project names. Name collisions receive suffixes such as `-2` and `-3`.

Application settings and the project index are stored in:

```text
%LOCALAPPDATA%\SplatStudio\settings.json
%LOCALAPPDATA%\SplatStudio\project-index.json
%LOCALAPPDATA%\SplatStudio\tasks.json
%LOCALAPPDATA%\SplatStudio\telemetry.json
```

These are Windows paths; macOS and Linux use their local application-data directories. Unstarted drafts, UI preferences, and preview views live in local WebView storage and do not travel with project files.

## Anonymous Usage Statistics

OOOSplat collects anonymous usage statistics by default to track stability and per-stage timings. Turn it off at any time under **Settings -> Privacy** in the top right; no anonymous analytics requests are sent once it is off.

What is sent:

| Field | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Install ID | A random UUID generated on first launch. No hardware serial, MAC address, or device fingerprint is read |
| App version, OS, CPU architecture | For example `0.6.0` / `windows` / `x86_64` |
| Event name | `daily_active`, `generation_started`, `generation_completed`, `generation_failed`, `pipeline_stage_completed`, `planner_evaluation`. `daily_active` is sent at most once a day, and once more on the day the app version changes |
| Quality preset and input type | Enumerated values such as `balanced` / `video`; an image-sequence input reports `images` |
| Stage and total durations | Milliseconds |
| Frame count and video duration in basic generation events | Bucketed values; Planner evaluation also includes actual media and reconstruction counts |
| Auto Optimize effectiveness metrics | Anonymous media dimensions and counts, plan, registered images and 3D points, bridge recovery, Brush configuration, Splat count, PLY size, and stage timings. Generation, resume, and reshoot all record them, including runs with Auto Optimize off |
| Planner GPU information | Vendor enumeration and detected total VRAM, without full adapter names or device serials. Unavailable values remain empty or unknown |
| Failing stage and error code | Enumerated values such as `colmap_mapper_failed`; no raw error text |

Anonymous analytics never sends: source media, including videos, images, and PLY files; file names, paths, and project names; logs and command output; user names or any personal information.

### Voluntary error reports

After generation fails, choose **Send error report**, review the complete redacted report, then choose **Agree and send**. Reports include the failure reason, error details, the latest failure-time log excerpt (up to 200 lines / 64 KiB), app version, system version, and all detectable graphics cards. They exclude media, models, device serials, and anonymous installation identifiers. Paths, filenames, and usernames are removed. Unavailable hardware fields are left empty; the actual GPU is never guessed.

Consent is separate and one-time: you can send a report even with anonymous analytics disabled, without enabling it. Cancelling the preview uploads nothing; failures can only be retried manually, and successful delivery shows a report ID. Local reports and previews remain valid for the current app session without a review time limit, and are cleared when the app closes. Reports received by the server are retained for 30 days. If the receiving service has not been deployed or the network is unavailable, the app reports delivery failure rather than claiming success. See the [receiving service integration guide](server/diagnostics/README.md).

## Bundled Engines

| Engine | Pinned version/build | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| FFmpeg / FFprobe | Windows x64 pinned 8.1-series LGPL shared build (n8.1.3-14-g330caae0c1); macOS arm64 8.1.2 LGPL shared; Ubuntu system packages | Video analysis and frame extraction |
| COLMAP | 4.2.1 same commit; Windows/Linux CUDA + Caspar/Ceres; macOS Ceres CPU | Feature extraction, matching, and camera reconstruction |
| Brush | OOOBrush ooo-v1.0.0; Windows/Linux x64, macOS arm64 | Headless Gaussian Splatting training and PLY export |

Windows, Ubuntu, and macOS source and integrity policies are recorded in [`engines/manifest.json`](engines/manifest.json), [`engines/manifest.linux.json`](engines/manifest.linux.json), and [`engines/manifest.macos.json`](engines/manifest.macos.json). Large engine files are not committed to Git; developers restore them with `npm run setup:engines`. Release builds verify sources, hashes, architecture, the dynamic-library closure, and Brush CLI compatibility.

Third-party licenses and notices are in [`licenses/`](licenses/):

- FFmpeg: LGPL-2.1-or-later; the selected build disables GPL/nonfree components.
- COLMAP: BSD-3-Clause.
- Brush: Apache-2.0.

## Local Development

### Download COLMAP Development Packages

On Windows and Ubuntu, `npm run setup:engines` downloads and verifies COLMAP and Brush. Windows also restores pinned FFmpeg/FFprobe; Ubuntu uses system FFmpeg/FFprobe. macOS prepares its runtime through the Apple Silicon development workflow below.

- COLMAP is downloaded from [**ooosplat-colmap**](https://github.com/ooolabdev/ooosplat-colmap).
- Brush is downloaded from [**OOOBrush**](https://github.com/ooolabdev/OOOBrush).

For manual installation, download the package for your platform from each repository's Releases page. Copy the extracted COLMAP contents into:

- Windows: `engines/colmap/` (`bin/colmap.exe`).
- Linux: `engines/linux/colmap/` (`bin/colmap`).
- macOS: `engines/macos/arm64/colmap/` (`bin/colmap`).

Keep the runtime libraries, licenses, and metadata together without adding another wrapper directory. `npm run dev:local` and `npm run build:local` also prepare and verify the pinned OOOBrush release.

See the [engine development package guide](engines/README.md) for directory layout and verification details.

### Windows Development Environment

- Node.js 22.12 or newer.
- Rust stable, targeting `x86_64-pc-windows-msvc`.
- Visual Studio 2022 Build Tools with Desktop development with C++.
- The WebView2 development/runtime environment required by Tauri 2.

Install dependencies and start development mode:

```powershell
npm install
npm run setup:engines
npm run tauri -- dev
```

### Ubuntu 24.04 Alpha Development

After installing the Ubuntu system dependencies, Node.js, and Rust:

```bash
npm ci
npm run setup:engines
npm run verify:engines
npm run verify:licenses
npm run tauri -- dev
```

From the repository root, `./scripts/start-app-linux.sh` (or `npm run start:app:linux`) verifies the local engines and license mappings, rebuilds the release executable only when the sources changed, and starts OOOSplat.

Ubuntu setup restores verified COLMAP under `engines/linux/colmap/` and Brush under `engines/linux/brush/`. FFmpeg/FFprobe remain system packages. The `.deb` embeds COLMAP/Brush and does not depend on system COLMAP.

The Ubuntu 24.04 Alpha CI workflow is in `.github/workflows/ubuntu.yml`. Standard GitHub runners cover frontend tests/build, license mappings, Rust tests, Clippy, FFmpeg integration, `.deb` creation, package validation, and upload of the installer plus SHA-256. Brush end-to-end coverage requires a host or self-hosted runner with a working graphics backend. The complete pipeline is currently validated on NVIDIA; AMD, Intel, and software Vulkan test results are welcome.

### macOS 15+ Apple Silicon Alpha Development

On an Apple Silicon Mac with Node.js, Rust, and Xcode Command Line Tools:

```bash
npm ci
npm run setup:engines
npm run verify:engines
npm run verify:licenses
npm run tauri -- dev
```

The download-and-start workflow above requires the mixed macOS runtime to be hash-locked. Its distribution hashes in `engines/manifest.macos.json` are currently empty, so regular `setup:engines` rejects installation. Initial local development must follow the [macOS CI workflow](.github/workflows/macos.yml) to build and verify the FFmpeg/Brush archive. COLMAP is installed from the separately pinned `ooosplat-colmap` Release. This restriction concerns source-development setup, not use of an installer that already contains the engines.

Homebrew supplies source-build prerequisites through `npm run setup:build-deps:macos`, followed by `npm run build:engines:macos`. macOS CI verifies that run's local archive before creating an unsigned app and DMG. Review and pin the archive and integrity-file hashes before enabling normal downloads of the manifest's archive.

### Tests and Checks

```powershell
# Frontend tests
npm test

# Frontend production build and TypeScript type-check
npm run build

# Rust tests
cargo test --manifest-path src-tauri\Cargo.toml

# Rust static checks
cargo clippy --manifest-path src-tauri\Cargo.toml --all-targets -- -D warnings

# Bundled engine version, hash, and CUDA runtime checks
npm run verify:engines

# First-party and third-party license checks
npm run verify:licenses
```

### Build the Windows Installer

```powershell
npm run package:windows
```

The NSIS installer is written to:

```text
dist-artifacts\OOOSplat-0.6.0-x64-windows.exe
```

Run `npm run setup:engines` before the first build. Tauri's `beforeBuildCommand` automatically runs the engine checks and frontend production build, but it does not access the network implicitly during packaging.

## CLI

The repository also provides the `splatstudio` diagnostic CLI:

```powershell
# Check all bundled engines
cargo run --manifest-path src-tauri\Cargo.toml --bin splatstudio -- health

# Read video metadata
cargo run --manifest-path src-tauri\Cargo.toml --bin splatstudio -- probe "D:\Videos\orbit.mp4"

# Show the frame extraction plan without writing frames
cargo run --manifest-path src-tauri\Cargo.toml --bin splatstudio -- plan "D:\Videos\orbit.mp4" --quality balanced

# Extract frames only
cargo run --manifest-path src-tauri\Cargo.toml --bin splatstudio -- extract "D:\Videos\orbit.mp4" "D:\Frames" --quality fast

# Run the complete pipeline
cargo run --manifest-path src-tauri\Cargo.toml --bin splatstudio -- generate "D:\Videos\orbit.mp4" --projects-root "D:\Splat Projects" --quality balanced

# Use the same command with a folder for an image sequence
cargo run --manifest-path src-tauri\Cargo.toml --bin splatstudio -- generate "D:\Photos\object" --projects-root "D:\Splat Projects" --quality balanced
```

For development or diagnostics, use the global `--engine-dir <path>` argument or the `OOOSPLAT_ENGINE_DIR` environment variable to override the default engine directory.

Linux FFmpeg/FFprobe retain their individual environment/PATH discovery. Brush defaults to managed `linux/brush/brush_app`, with no PATH fallback; explicit `OOOSPLAT_BRUSH` diagnostic overrides must support the new CLI. COLMAP is resolved only as `linux/colmap/bin/colmap` below the managed root, with no individual `OOOSPLAT_COLMAP` or PATH fallback.

## MCP (optional)

Enable it under Settings → MCP to let local AI agents such as Codex create, start, inspect, and cancel tasks and read logs. These tasks appear in the application. The service is off by default, listens only on `127.0.0.1`, and needs no token.

See the [MCP documentation](docs/mcp-v1.md) for connection and configuration examples.

## FAQ

### Why is COLMAP using the CPU instead of the GPU?

On Windows and Ubuntu, OOOSplat enables COLMAP GPU acceleration when the pinned CUDA runtime is healthy and NVIDIA driver 580.00 or newer and Compute Capability 7.5 or higher are confirmed. Caspar additionally requires a successful tiny BA probe; failure selects Ceres CPU without disabling otherwise available SIFT GPU acceleration. Configuration pages show detected capabilities; the running task's details and logs show its actual backend. A temporary background detection timeout does not switch an active task to CPU. macOS COLMAP uses the CPU, while Brush selects its graphics backend independently.

### How does OOOSplat handle different GPU combinations?

COLMAP and Brush are separate stages. COLMAP requires a compatible NVIDIA CUDA environment for GPU acceleration. Brush uses Vulkan on Windows and Linux and Metal on Apple Silicon macOS. Common configurations are handled as follows; rows without an explicit platform refer to Windows:

| Platform and GPU configuration | COLMAP | Brush training | Detailed Auto Optimize VRAM profile |
|---|---|---|---|
| Windows: one NVIDIA discrete GPU | Uses CUDA when the driver and Compute Capability requirements are met | Explicitly selects the first discrete GPU and runs through Vulkan | Uses that NVIDIA GPU's total VRAM to select Low, Standard, or Large |
| Intel integrated GPU + one NVIDIA discrete GPU | Uses the compatible NVIDIA GPU through CUDA | Explicitly selects the first discrete GPU instead of the Intel integrated GPU | Uses NVIDIA total VRAM |
| AMD integrated GPU + one NVIDIA discrete GPU | Uses the compatible NVIDIA GPU through CUDA | Explicitly selects the first discrete GPU and bypasses the AMD Switchable Graphics implicit layer for the Brush child process only | Uses NVIDIA total VRAM |
| AMD only, or Intel integrated GPU + AMD discrete GPU | Falls back to CPU | Vulkan automatically selects an AMD GPU; the AMD graphics layer is not disabled | Currently uses the conservative Low profile |
| Intel integrated or discrete GPU only | Falls back to CPU | Vulkan automatically selects an Intel GPU | Currently uses the conservative Low profile |
| Multiple NVIDIA GPUs | Selects the compatible GPU with the highest Compute Capability, then the lower NVIDIA index on a tie | Does not force a Brush device index because Vulkan and CUDA indices cannot be mapped reliably; Vulkan selects automatically | Uses the total VRAM of the GPU selected for COLMAP |
| AMD discrete GPU + NVIDIA discrete GPU | Uses a compatible NVIDIA GPU for COLMAP | Currently enters the single-NVIDIA preference path, but cross-vendor Vulkan ordering cannot be guaranteed; also set `brush_app.exe` to High performance in Windows Graphics settings and verify the actual adapter in the task log | Uses NVIDIA total VRAM |
| Old NVIDIA driver, unsupported NVIDIA model, or failed detection | Falls back to CPU | Brush still attempts to select an available GPU through Vulkan but does not force NVIDIA | Currently uses the conservative Low profile |
| No usable GPU graphics backend | Uses CPU for COLMAP | Brush may not start; CPU-only software graphics has not been validated end to end | Not applicable |
| macOS: Apple Silicon M series, including Pro, Max, and Ultra | Currently uses the CPU; CUDA is not enabled | Automatically uses the M-series Metal GPU and unified memory | Currently stays on the conservative Low profile instead of scaling from unified-memory capacity |
| Ubuntu Alpha: compatible NVIDIA GPU | Uses CUDA when the runtime, driver, and Compute Capability checks pass, otherwise CPU | Vulkan selects automatically without Windows-specific adapter overrides | Uses compatible NVIDIA total VRAM to select Low, Standard, or Large |
| Ubuntu Alpha: AMD, Intel, or no detectable compatible NVIDIA GPU | Uses CPU | Vulkan selects an available GPU automatically | Uses the conservative Low profile |

Forced adapter selection and the AMD implicit-layer workaround are passed only to the individual `brush_app.exe` child process. OOOSplat does not modify the system environment, driver configuration, or other applications, and it does not switch Brush to D3D12. AMD-only systems do not receive the AMD implicit-layer workaround.

If the Brush log reports `Device Lost`, OOOSplat distinguishes it from an out-of-memory failure and shows guidance, but it does not automatically lower quality and retry. Connect the computer to power, close other GPU-heavy applications, and set `brush_app.exe` to High performance under Windows Settings → System → Display → Graphics. Detailed quality lowers its profile and retries at most once only after an explicit out-of-memory failure.

M-series CPUs and GPUs share unified memory, but the current Planner does not treat unified memory as dedicated VRAM. Consequently, even an M-series Pro, Max, or Ultra with substantial memory currently uses the Detailed Low profile. This is a conservative compatibility policy; it does not mean Metal training can access only a small portion of unified memory.

### Why does OOOSplat warn about a low registration rate?

A low registration rate usually means COLMAP could not find enough continuous, overlapping viewpoints. The task still continues to Brush, but result quality may be affected. Use an orbit video with stable exposure, clear frames, continuous movement, and sufficient viewpoint overlap. Avoid fast rotation, strong reflections, large plain-color areas, and moving subjects.

### Why does a project use so much disk space?

Each project keeps source copies, input images, COLMAP data, and Brush intermediates for diagnostics and resuming. Image sequences prefer internal hard links to reduce duplicate physical copies. After confirming the result, use Delete in Task List to move the complete project to the Recycle Bin.

### Can I view final.ply directly in OOOSplat?

Yes. Select “Preview” on a completed project in the task list to open its `.ply` in the dedicated preview workspace. “Adjust” supports whole-model Transform plus rectangle, sphere, and box Gaussian selection, with non-destructive deletion, cropping, inversion, undo, and redo. Edits are saved automatically in the project; “Save edits” confirms that the current edits and view have been saved without creating a model file. “Export → Export PLY” creates or updates the single `edit.ply`, while the original `final.ply` remains unchanged. Reopening restores the edits and the view saved on this device; yellow selections and undo history do not persist between sessions. “Animation” adds a 5-second reveal, an 8-second shockwave, a continuous orbit, watermarked portrait/landscape MP4 export, and offline HTML export. `.sog` and `.spz` are not supported yet.

### Can I preview very large PLY files?

PLY files larger than 256 MiB load through Range requests of about 1 MB each to reduce full-file buffering during transfer. This does not compress, downsample, or discard SH data. Parsing, sorting, and GPU textures still need RAM and VRAM; whether a model opens depends on its size and the device, so not every large model is guaranteed to load.

## Technology

The preview Export menu supports PLY, portrait/landscape video, and single-file offline HTML. HTML preserves all undeleted Gaussians and SH data, initially displays the complete edited result, and supports offline orbit, pan, zoom, and manual animation playback. Mouse interaction pauses animation. It prefers WebGPU and falls back to WebGL2, offers no model editing, and contains no project paths, source media, logs, or telemetry. The file is about 4/3 of the corresponding PLY size plus viewer resources; large models still depend on device capacity. Development and build commands generate the offline runtime first; before running Rust alone, run `npm run build:html-viewer` if needed.
